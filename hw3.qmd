## 6.14. 
***Explain the difference between footprint and spacing of an energy technology. What are some of the uses of the spacing?*** 

The footprint is the physical area on the topsoil or water that is touched by an energy technology. Spacing is the area that is essentially "in between" the energy technologies. For instance, wind turbines require a certain spacing for optimal energy production and to prevent harm to the surrounding locations and each other. Spacing can be used for agriculture, other energy technologies like solar arrays, or can exist as forests/open space. 

## 6.16. 
***How many 5-MW onshore wind turbines with a rotor diameter of 126 m operating in a mean annual wind speed of 7.5 m/s are needed to power the U.S. on-road vehicle fleet consisting of battery-electric (BE) vehicles if the end-use energy required to run such a fleet is Ev = 1.15 × 1012 kWh/y (2017) and the plug-to-wheel efficiency of an electric vehicle is ηe = 0.85? Assume the system efficiency of each wind turbine is ηt = 0.9. Hint: First determine the total electrical energy required to run the fleet by dividing the end-use energy required to run vehicles by the plug-to-wheel efficiency.*** 

```{python}

# --- electric vehicle fleet

# Chapter 7 

## 7.1. 
***Explain the difference between primary energy and end-use energy.***

Primary energy is the energy released by breaking chemical bonds in raw fuels, or the solar/wind/geothermal that is naturally available as renewable energy. End-use energy is the energy consumed by various applications after primary energy has been converted, transmitted, and distribution losses have been accounted for.

## 7.4. 
***Identify four ways that electrifying all energy and providing the electricity with 100 percent wind, water, and solar reduces end-use power demand. ***

1. Electric vehicles are more efficient than combustion vehicles, so they need less energy to run.
2. In producing high temperature heat in industiral settings, electric appliances are also far more efficient than current combustion-based techniques, which decreases the end use demand.
3. End use demand is also decreased by using heat-pumps, which rely on heat transfer to create comforable infoor temperatures, rather than generating heat from fuel.
4. Using renewable sources eliminates the need for energy to mine, transport and process fossil fuels, which decreases end-use demand
