\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The world urgently needs to transition to 100\% clean, renewable energy.
This fact is particulary difficult to come to terms with in oil-rich
developing countries such as Nigeria. Here, the mining, sale, and use of
abundant fossil fuels is expected to pave the way to economic
prosperity. However, a cursory glance at the country's history reveals
that fossil fuels have certainly not improved socio-economic outcomes to
date. Many attribute the rampant inequality and environmental
degredation in the oil-rich Niger Delta to the extractive economies that
fossil fuels generate. Additionally, Nigeria has the \emph{xth} poorest
electricity service on the African continent. Despite being the
\emph{9th} largest producer of crude oil in the world, Nigeria is a net
importer of energy. A recently opened petroleum refinery, \emph{Dangote
oil..} is expected to change this. However, this refinery will process
\emph{x\%} of Nigeria's energy demand. Considering that it took \emph{x}
years for this refinery to come online, it is doubtful that complete
dependence on fossil fuels is the way forward for a population that is
expected to \emph{double?} in size over the next \emph{x} years. Rather
than simply abandoning its ``crown jewel'', Nigeria would be making a
proactive choice to preserve its natural resources, protect its
environment, bolster its economy (\emph{the government spends how much
to import refined oil}), and provide clean energy for its people if it
chose to transition to 100\% clean, renewable energy.

\hypertarget{energy-consumption-in-the-status-quo}{%
\section{Energy Consumption in the Status
Quo}\label{energy-consumption-in-the-status-quo}}

According to \emph{source}, Nigeria consumed x kWh of end-use energy in
year. This energy came from the followiing primary sources, and was
consumed by the following sectors. Considering that only x\% of people
have access to grid electricity, we know that demand is much greater
than what is currently being consumed. Additionally, we know that
generators which run on diesel fuel account for x\% of end-use energy
demand in the country\ldots{} The entire electricity generation capacity
within Nigeria is \ldots. P This takes into accounts all sectors except
for transportation.

\hypertarget{a-note-on-transportation}{%
\subsection{A Note on Transportation}\label{a-note-on-transportation}}

A clean, renewable future in Nigeria would require a re-think of
transportation entrirely. Although it has the greatest number of cars on
the African continent x, this is still x car/person. Even with this
number of cars, the traffic in Nigeria's cities is already a significant
barrier to greater economic productivity and individual well-being
\emph{(x hours)}. Given the high cost of personal vehicles relative to
income, cities in Nigeria should focus on combining efficient, electic
public transport and freight with electric last-mile shared vehicles,
which may look more along the lines of ke-ke napeps (three-wheeled
vehicles) and e-bikes than automobiles.
