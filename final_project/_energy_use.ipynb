        "This study focuses primarily on evaluatig the possibility of using solar and wind turbine energy. I began by calculating the renewable resources that would be available in each state. I used data from (**) to determine the average wind speed, temperature, and solar flux (direct normal irradiation **), available in each of the 36 Nigerian states. The aim was to identify which states had the greatest potential for producing renewable energy. After identifying these states, I calculated the amount of energy that could be generated from solar and wind farms in these locations, as well as the number of panels/turbines that would be needed, and the amount of space that would be taken up. I structured my calculations in such that I could evaluate how land used and items needed would change with different configurations. \n"

I used a standard derating factor, solar panel efficiency, and area (TODO: make table). All of these calculations were carried out in the `calculate_power_panel()` function, which, by passing in the solar flux, ambient temperature and wind speed values averaged over the area of each state, enabled me to calculate the average AC power output of a single panel in each state.\n",

This function takes in `p_land`, or percentage of land, and `num_states` or number of states as inputs. I determine which states have the highest average power ouput for a single solar panel, and I decide to place panels in these states, up to `num_states`. Within each state, I calculate the percentage of land that will be available for solar panels using `p_land`. I then use the area of the input panels to determine how many panels can be placed in this available area. I multiply the resulting number of panels by the potential power output of a single panel in the state to get the average power ouput. To get the average total energy, I multiply the power by 8760 hours in a year. \n",
