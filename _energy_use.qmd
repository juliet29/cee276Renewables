# Background

This study focuses primarily on evaluatig the possibility of using solar and wind turbine energy. I began by calculating the renewable resources that would be available in each state. I used data from (**) to determine the average wind speed, temperature, and solar flux (direct normal irradiation **), available in each of the 36 Nigerian states. The aim was to identify which states had the greatest potential for producing renewable energy. After identifying these states, I calculated the amount of energy that could be generated from solar and wind farms in these locations, as well as the number of panels/turbines that would be needed, and the amount of space that would be taken up. I structured my calculations in such that I could evaluate how land used and items needed would change with different configurations.

## Calculate Current Energy Demand 
TODO: use data from sources 



## Calculate Available Renewable Resource 

Using satellite data from .., I am able to see the renewable resouce availability at relatively high resolutions of about 250 m2. In theory, this allows me to pinpoint the exact locations where solar and wind turbines might be located. However, given the high amounts of data, and the discrpancy in labelling between the inputs this would be computationally intesnive, and is left for another study. Instead, I use the state administrative boundaries as a unifying region with which to evaluate all the data I am bringing in. In particular, I use:
    - Wind Speed (m/s): Used to to calculate the power in the wind that is available to wind turbines 
    - Wind Speed at Surface (TODO)
    - Temperature (ÂºC): Average temperatures the panels will be exposed to 
    - Solar Flux: Available energy for solar panels 

```{python}


states_path = "data/states/nga_admbnda_adm1_osgof_20161215.shp"
states = gpd.read_file(states_path)

data_averages = {}
for name, path in data_paths.items():
    data_averages[name] = pd.read_csv(f"clean_data/{name}.csv", index_col=0)

# TODO: 2x4 subplots for resources in each states (wind, surface_wind, flux, temperature, )


```
TODO: commentary on how different the data is, and how much of a simpliciation are making  => maybe even plot distributions of the data... for states vs raw data => if means are lower, we are underestimating the available power...

# Calculate Solar Contribution 

To calculate the contribution from solar panels, I calculated the cell temperature, T_c, that each solar panel in a given state would be exposed to using (Eq. 5.7). I then computed
